## Known issues (that can't be fixed in the nearby future):

1. Editing LARGE files (30kb+) may slow down loading & customization experience.

2. Lots of images aren't supported by the image previewer.

3. The error handler is not so advanced.. so in case of Error, a popup displays the error and the editor crashes.

4. Multi-line strings/comments are not highlighted due to a "pygments" problem

<hr>

## Questions:

1. What is the codename scheme?

\> An adjective and a noun with same initials (currently preview is at "V": "Visual Vector")

2. Why i made whirledit?

\> This project started as a simple project on my way learning tkinter Later, in May-June 2021 The project restarted as i got ideas for tabs and using "ttk".
